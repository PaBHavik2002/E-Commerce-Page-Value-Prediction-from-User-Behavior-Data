E-Commerce Page Value Prediction from User Behavior Data

Overview
This project aims to predict the Page Value of e-commerce website sessions using user clickstream and engagement data. Page Value represents the average monetary value generated by a page, and understanding it can help online retailers identify which pages contribute most to conversions and overall revenue.

Dataset
The dataset contains 12,330 sessions, each described by a range of behavioral and contextual features:
  Administrative & Informational Pages – number of visits and total time spent
  Product-Related Pages – key engagement measure for purchase behavior
  Bounce Rates & Exit Rates – indicators of session quality
  Page Values – the target variable for prediction
  SpecialDay, Month, VisitorType, Weekend – contextual session details

Feature Engineering
Following exploratory data analysis, several new features were created to better capture user patterns:
  Ratios of specific page types to total pages viewed
  Time distribution across page categories
  Engagement metrics combining duration, value, and bounce rates
  Seasonal variables derived from the Month feature
  Flags identifying high-value visitors and highly engaged weekend sessions

Models Evaluated
Multiple regression models were trained and compared:
  Linear Regression – baseline model for interpretability
  Polynomial Regression – captures non-linear relationships
  Lasso Regularization (L1) – feature selection and noise reduction
  Random Forest Regression – ensemble approach for complex patterns
  Gradient Boost Regression – boosting method for improved accuracy

Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was assessed using:
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – chosen because it expresses error in the same units as the target variable, making results easier to interpret
  R² (Coefficient of Determination) – measures how effectively the model captures variance in Page Value

Results
RMSE values were consistent between training and testing, showing good generalization.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved the best balance of low RMSE and high R².
Time spent on product-related pages and session engagement patterns were strong predictors of Page Value.
